# WP Libre Formbuilder
Graphical User Interface for WP Libre Form. You control the markup, but your end-users can build forms without any HTML knowledge. Work in progress and does not work with any existing release of WP Libre Form. Repository will live under https://github.com/libreform organisation when  finished. 

## Why no drag & drop?
DnD interfaces are often tedious to use. Sure, they work great on desktop, when there's one level, but complex forms may have any number of levels. Using mobile devices with limited screen space makes it spectacularly easy to ~~ruin everything~~ misplace elements.

By not relying on DnD the code stays relatively simple, and works on every device. You have controls for moving fields up and down, and a field to move a field anywhere in the form.
